            Hello! My name is Jamie Barton. I am 22 years old and have always had a passion for different technologies!  
            Ever sense I was young I have loved playing video games and messing around on computers. This lead me down a path
            to begin coding and wanting to understand how computers work.

            I was born and raised in Tucson Arizona, and I went to Catilina Foothills High School.  I went to NAU for two years out of high
            school but ended up moving back because I missed Tucson.  While I was at NUA I began studying Electrical Engineering, but decided after my first semester
            that I did not like hardware aspect.  After this I found Computer Science!  I struggled for a while with programming at first but began
            to like it more after I got some experience under my belt! After moving back to Tucson I went to Pima for a year and then moved to U of A for a year!

            I enjoy hanging out with my friends, playing piano, and playing chess! I also like to go outside when it's not too hot and
            slackline! I have 3 cats and a dog, that I love very much.  All of my imediate family lives in Tucson as well.  My brother is a web designer,
            my Mom is a Pilates teacher and my Dad teaches geo-chemistry at U of A.
